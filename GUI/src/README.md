# ElecLoc GUI

## Possible enhancements (TODO's)

- Add CT's min and max in the placeholder of the thresholds QLineEdit widgets
- Add a progress bar during the computation of centroids (extraction)
- Add basic keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+O, Del to delete centroid, ...)
- Unselect centroid when clicking twice on it
- Fix the size of some widgets (e.g. add/delete centroid buttons)
- Fix varying widget extraction panel size when the Centroid menu is shown or hidden
- Dialogs to instruct the user to wait while loading nifti files or computing centroids
